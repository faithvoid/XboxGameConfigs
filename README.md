# Xbox Unreal Configs
Modified default.ini files for various Xbox games to maximize performance. Feel free to make pull requests if you have better changes to optimize performance!

# Current Modified Games:
- Unreal Championship - Tested, improves FPS by the smallest margin (maybe 1-2FPS extra, but free FPS is free FPS). Must create a new profile for the settings to take effect!. Might crash the game sometimes? Need to test more.
- Deus Ex: Invisible War - Tested, can't tell if there's a performance difference or not.
- Unreal Championship 2 - Untested.
- Unreal II - Untested, one of the options currently seems to crash the Xbox.
- Advent Rising - Untested.
