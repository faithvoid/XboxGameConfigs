# Xbox Game Configs
Modified configuration files for various Xbox games to maximize performance. Feel free to make pull requests if you have better changes to optimize performance!

# Current Modified Games:
- Unreal Championship - Tested, seems to stablize FPS by a noticeable degree. Must create a new save (and delete any previous ones) to use!
- Deus Ex: Invisible War - Tested, can't tell if there's a performance difference or not.
- Unreal Championship 2 - Untested.
- Unreal II - Untested, one of the options currently seems to crash the Xbox.
- Advent Rising - Untested.
